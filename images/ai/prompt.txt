It is a concept for an rpg game. You are in a Pine tree forest with a road. You are in the middle fo the forest, but you can see an ancient ruin ahead. It seems to be an ancient temple. It is huge, and there is probably an adventure inside. from some lost civilization who lived there thousands of years ago. It has a nordic and megalitic style combined. You are close to a river too.  The art style is a sort of mixture beween dark souls and dangeons and dragons, god of war 2 and Skyrim. You should use stronger collors, with high contrast due to the light and darkness, since you are in the morning, but the wheather is fogg. 
Style guide:
Dark Souls: 40%
Dungeons and Dragons: 20%
